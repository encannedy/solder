Daily Planner

The app will allow for a user to keep track of a standard business schedule.
When the app is loaded, the current day will be displayed with the full date.
The app has a textarea for each hour block which will save on local storage and should persist through
the browser being closed or refreshed.
A user can enter an event by clicking on a timeblock, entering text and saving the event using the save key.
Saving an event is saved to local storage.
If the time block is in the present, the textarea will be red, if it is in the past it will be grey and if in the future it will green.
